       <p>You are a new player in a massive virtual world called “CodeQuest.” Your character stands at the entrance of the Tutorial Zone, staring at glowing symbols floating in the air.</p>
       <p>"Player," says the system voice, "our main program is broken. Bugs are spreading through the world, and only someone willing to learn can fix them."</p>
       <p>You remember that you planned to just play casually tonight, maybe explore easy levels and collect rewards. Learning the rules looks hard, but without you, the game world could crash.</p>
       <p>What do you do? Enter the tutorial, or log out?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer02">
        <p>Answer Yes when you're ready!</p>

        <p>Please answer yes or no.</p>

    <div class="storyPart" id="answer11">
        <p>Great choice! The Tutorial Zone lights up as you step inside, and the system congratulates you for starting your journey.</p>
        <p>You learn your first commands, pack your inventory with patience, and prepare for the challenge ahead.</p>
        <p>The first levels are calm. You practice typing, reading messages, and solving small puzzles.</p>
        <p>After a while, everything feels manageable—until a warning flashes on the screen.</p>
        <p>"Syntax Error."</p>
        <p>Your companion AI, GizmoBot, beeps nervously. It looks like you made a mistake.</p>
        <p>You can either fix the error by thinking it through, or quit and reload an easier save. What will you do?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer12">
        <p>You decide to log out. Someone else will fix the bugs. Besides, easy games don’t require much effort, and they’re more relaxing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="err1">
        <p>Please answer Tutorial or Exit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer21">
        <p>You take a deep breath and fix the error. It takes time, and a few retries, but suddenly the code works.</p>
        <p>The system rewards you with a new skill: Problem Solving! GizmoBot cheers as new areas unlock.</p>
        <p>You continue forward, knowing the game will only get harder—but also more rewarding.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer22">
         <p>You give up and reload an old save.</p>
         <p>When you return to the main menu, a message appears from the system administrator.</p>
         <p>It explains that mistakes are part of the game, and quitting early means never reaching the best levels.</p>
         <p>The message fades. You sit there, wondering what could have happened if you had tried just one more time.</p>
         <p>Oh well. At least the menu music is nice.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="err2">
         <p>Please answer Fix It or Quit.</p>
