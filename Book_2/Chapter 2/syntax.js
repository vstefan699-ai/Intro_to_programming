/* 
-----------multi comment line----------

Write some text directly to the HTML output by using document.write().
document.write() still works perfectly in all major browsers for now, but it's deprecated, meaning it's discouraged and may be removed in future versions.

 \" is an escape character.It tells JavaScript to treat the double quote as a character, not the end of the string.
